# Project Estimation

# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size

| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                    | 72000    |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week) | 15       |

# Summary

|                                    | Estimated effort (person hour) | Estimated duration (weeks, 4 people) |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| estimate by size                   | 2400                           | 15                                   |
| estimate by product decomposition  | 2920                           | 18.25                                |
| estimate by activity decomposition | 2648                           | 16.55                                |

The difference in the estimation can be related to the focus on different points of view of the same project. A wide point of view like the estimation by size can lead to underestimation of the project, while doing a deeper analysis can lead to overestimation.
