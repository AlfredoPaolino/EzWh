# Project Estimation

# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size

| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed                                                      | 30       |

| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)                                                       | 12000    |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (assuming 14 LOC per person hour based on the project we did)    | 857      |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                    | 25710    |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week) | 6        |

# Summary

|                                    | Estimated effort (person hour) | Estimated duration (weeks, 4 people) |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| estimate by size                   | 857                            | 6                                    |
| estimate by product decomposition  | 550                            | 4                                    |
| estimate by activity decomposition | 600                            | 4                                    |

The difference in the estimation can be related to the focus on different points of view of the same project. A wide point of view like the estimation by size can lead to underestimation of the project, while doing a deeper analysis can lead to overestimation.
